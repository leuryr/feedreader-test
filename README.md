# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and their last company was left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I came in.


## Running the Test Page

Download and unpack the repository to your computer, then open index.html to run the feedreader tester in your browser window.


You'll find that all tests are **green** and **passing**!
